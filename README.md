## CommonFetchAPI

- The Fetch API is a modern web API for making network requests in JavaScript. 
- It provides a simpler and more flexible alternative to XMLHttpRequest (XHR). 
- To use the Fetch API, you create a new Request object, which contains information about the resource you want to fetch. 
- You can then pass this Request object to the fetch() function, which returns a Promise that resolves to a Response object containing the response data.
- You can use methods on the Response object to extract the data you need, such as text(), json(), or blob().
